#### An application for users (zoo staff), to be able to add newly-admitted animals to the app. 7/7/2017

#### By **Dylan Dills**

##Description
Welcome to Zooboomafoo! The wonderful zoo filled with joy and laughter for all. We love getting new animals and keeping try of the ones we have, but our old way of adding or looking them up in our zoo database wasn't really working. So, we have invented a new way! Come along the ride as you are able to see all the animals we currently have at our zoo and are even able to filter them if they are over or under two years old. You can also edit any animal we have on our list, in case you need to update basic information, or Zoboo, our house lemur, decided to mess with our computer again and you need to clean up his mess. You can even add new animals, putting in all the information we need to to ourselves and, most importantly, animals happy.
